# GDC Game Jam Fall 2024
_________________________

My first completed game as a beginner game developer at a game jam.

The whole theme was bug and I decided to go up with a 2D platformer shooter, where you deliver packages under a certain time limit. 
Overall, it was a lot of fun making this game and I have learned a lot for any future games I make I have gotten my worth from this. 
Obviously not the coolest thing or prettiest but in terms of my growth, I think I got it, it was cool to develop and learn about games.  

Frankly, I can use the stuff I learned for other projects.

Also the code base is messy but I had 48 Hours to do this and making it clean went out of mind but for future projects where I have more time,
I will make sure the code is cleaner and nicer. 

Have fun with the game.
